<h2 align="middle">Project Description</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we are creating an audio visualizer using fire simulations that react to changes in features in music like frequency, tempo, and key. 
    We represent a set of frequency bands as a set of fires, and each fire changes in color, amplitude, or smokiness in real time according to the 
    aforementioned music feature changes. Our final product will be a video that shows the fire simulations corresponding to a few different songs.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Accomplishments</h2>
<p>
    Our work up to this point has focused on real time fire rendering. We have been using Three.js for real time rendering with WebGL. Initially, we 
    were planning to go with a more realistic fire, but we have since learned the limitations of our WebGl API, and have decided to go for something more 
    stylized. So far, we have created a real-time fire and spark rendering using particles and added perlin noise, and have implemented a smoke effect
    using a simple navier-stokes fluid simulation.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Preliminary Results</h2>

<h3>Smoke Simulation</h3>
<p>In the video below, we can see smoke coming out of a source in the ground, rising into the air, and wrapping around a ball. Our smoke model uses 
    the Navier-Stokes model for fluid simulation, and then we add in some temperature advection to account for how smoke rises with hot temperatures
    and sinks with cool temperatures.

<h3>Realistic Fire Rendering</h3>
<p>
    As we began to render fire, we realized how important it was for it to be physically realistic. We've incorporated drag and gravity in order to model the physics of the simulation. In addition, we have now added low pressure points that particles gravitate toward. In the video below, the pressure points are exaggerated so their effect is clear to the viewer. We plan to finalize adjustment of our parameters (including particle size, particle life span, etc.) to ensure the most realistic fire rendering.

<h2 align="middle">Work Plan</h2>
<h3>Progress relative to work plan</h3>
<p>
    We have been a little bit behind schedule on getting our fire rendering done, as we had originally planned to be done with the fire rendering
    and have moved on to the audio implementation by now. The WebGL rendering environment was a bit tricky to set up, but now that we have all of the
    individual parts working, it shouldn't take much longer to finish our fire implementation. We primarily have to integrate the smoke simulation into 
    the particle fire. We also spent more time in week 1 deciding on how we would
    implement the model, and how it should look. Luckily, we built in a good amount of buffer room into our schedule. We also will likely not finish
    some of our aspirational goals, like adding more effects to our fire and connecting to a Spotify API.
</p>

<h3>Updated work plan</h3>
<p>
    <b>Week 3:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Integrate smoke simulation into fire model
        </li>
        <li>
            Implement parameterization for fires, so that we will later be able to modulate amplitude and color with
            audio cues
        </li>
        <li>
            Implement an API for discrete Fourier transform in our JavaScript webapp, apply it to some demo songs to generate
            parameters for the fire modulation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Week 4:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Integrate audio and fire simulation. This will consist of creating a row of individual fires that change color
            and amplitude based on our audio analysis
        </li>
        <li>
            Create video demo and final presentation.
        </li>
    </ul>
